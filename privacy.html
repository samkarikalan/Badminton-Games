<h1>Privacy Policy for Club Scheduler</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2026-01-07</p>

<h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
<p>
Club Scheduler does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.
All information entered into the app remains locally stored on the user’s device.

<p>
Data entered by users (such as player names, schedules, and settings) is used
only to operate app features and is never transmitted outside the device.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
No data is shared with third parties. The app does not use analytics,
advertising SDKs, or cloud services.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
<p>
All app data remains on the device until cleared by the user or when the app
is uninstalled. Uninstalling the app permanently removes all stored data.

Because all data is stored locally, it is protected by the device’s operating
system security features.

This app is not intended for children under 13 and does not knowingly collect
